Hi, I'm Ole.

I am a PhD student in physical oceanography at [AWI](https://www.awi.de/en/about-us/organisation/staff/single-view/ole-pinner.html), studying the connection of turbulence and the export of Antarctic Bottom Water. 

See some work of mine like
- 🇦🇶 [Internal-wave-induced dissipation rates in the Weddell Sea Bottom Water gravity current](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2444)  
   my most recent paper, published in *Ocean Science*. 
- 📚 [OceanAtmosWiki](https://ocean.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page)  
   a public Wiki, which contains information about scientific programming, Gender & Diversity and general a lot I find useful during my PhD
- 🎥 [Oceanography in a Tea Cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPAmPI1otgs), a scientific short film about the topic of my Phd thesis. 
- ⚖️ the Task Group "Gender & Diversity" in the [TRR 181 project – Energy Transfers in Atmosphere and Ocean](https://www.trr-energytransfers.de/about-us).
