Hi, I'm Ole.

I am a PhD student in physical oceanography at [AWI](https://www.awi.de/en/about-us/organisation/staff/single-view/ole-pinner.html), studying the connection of turbulence and the export of Antarctic Bottom Water. 

See some work of mine like
- 🇦🇶 [Internal-wave-induced dissipation rates in the Weddell Sea Bottom Water gravity current](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2444)  
   my most recent paper, published in *Ocean Science*.
- 🌐 [Spilhaus map projection](https://github.com/opinner/spilhaus), for a map of one continous world ocean.
- ⛰️ Plot arbitrary topobathymetric data as a [beautiful ridge map](https://github.com/opinner/ridge_map).
- 📚 [Good Scientific Practice - in Practice](https://github.com/opinner/Good-Scientific-Practice-in-Practice) A curated collection of resources, ranging from basic to very specific to climate sciences/oceanography 
- 🎥 [Oceanography in a Tea Cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPAmPI1otgs), a scientific short film introducing the topic of my Phd thesis. 
- ⚖️ the Task Group "Gender & Diversity" in the [TRR 181 project – Energy Transfers in Atmosphere and Ocean](https://www.trr-energytransfers.de/about-us).
- 🕸️ [OceanAtmosWiki](https://ocean.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page), a public Wiki (although quite sparse) with information about scientific programming, Gender & Diversity and general a lot of the things I find useful.
